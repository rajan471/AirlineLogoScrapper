# Airline logo scapper in NodeJS

This module scraps the airline logos from the google search page. A list of airlines is passed ( in `./airlines.js` file) and it loops through each of them to scrap the logo.

This module can also be modified to do other scraping tasks like scraping a shopping e-commerce website for a particular product prices, etc.

You can also find the scrapped logos in the logos folder as well.

To start the project run the following commands in `$bash` or `cmd`:

```
npm i
npm start
```
